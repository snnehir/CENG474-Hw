Aim of this assignment is to understand the difference between ECB and CBC mode.

## Project setup

### You should have Python version 3+ installed

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3911/


### In command prompt go to project directory
```
cd Assignment2
```

### Install required packages
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 1- To run ecb.py in terminal
```
python ecb_mode/ecb.py
```

### Encrypted image obtained with ECB mode

Encryption using ECB mode is not secure since we can see the outline of the original image.


### 2- To run cbc.py
```
python cbc_mode/cbc.py
```

### Encrypted image obtained with CBC mode

Encryption using CBC is more secure since we cannot guess the plain image from encrypted image.

*Encrypted and decrypted images can be found under each folder.
